# My Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration. It is a work in progress and I am
constantly tweaking it. I try to keep it minimal and only include plugins that
offer significant improvements. I also try to use the default ways of configuring
Neovim when possible.

## Plugins to try out

- noice.nvim (mainly for the enhanced f and t montions)
- nvim-bqf
- avante.nvim
- grug-far.nvim
- harpoon or alternatives (per branch file list)
- dap and dap-ui
- vim-test or neotest
- dbee or dadbod
- dial.nvim
- hardtime.nvim

## Todos to figure out
