# My Neovim Config

This is my personal neovim configuration. It is a work in progress and I am
constantly tweaking it. I have tried to keep it as modular as possible for
maintainability.

## Plugins to try out

- undotree
- noice.nvim
- nvim-bqf
- trouble.nvim
- avante.nvim
- grug-far.nvim
- harpoon or alternatives
- dap and dap-ui
- vim-test or neotest
- dbee or dadbod

## Todos to figure out

- make oil git status show in the signcolumn, not in the file name
