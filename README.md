# My Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration. It is a work in progress and I am
constantly tweaking it. I have tried to keep it as modular as possible for
maintainability.

## Plugins to try out

- noice.nvim (mainly for the enhanced f and t montions)
- nvim-bqf
- trouble.nvim (could be replaced by Snacks.picker)
- avante.nvim
- grug-far.nvim
- harpoon or alternatives (per branch file list)
- dap and dap-ui
- vim-test or neotest
- dbee or dadbod
- dial.nvim
- hardtime.nvim

## Todos to figure out
