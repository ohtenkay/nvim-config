# My Neovim Config

This is my personal neovim configuration. It is a work in progress and I am constantly tweaking it. I have tried to keep it as modular as possible for maintainability.

## Plugins to try out
- flash.nvim
- oil.nvim
- harpoon
- which-key.nvim
- noice.nvim
- nvim-bqf
- copilot.lua
- lazygit.nvim
- nvim-dap
