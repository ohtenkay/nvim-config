# My Neovim Config

This is my personal neovim configuration. It is a work in progress and I am
constantly tweaking it. I have tried to keep it as modular as possible for
maintainability.

## Plugins to try out

- harpoon (or alternatives)
- floaterm
- which-key.nvim
- undotree
- noice.nvim
- nvim-bqf
